    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      An easy, no-yeast recipe for Dutch pancakes, which are called "poffertjes"
      in the Netherlands. They are traditionally made in a poffertjes pan which
      has indents, but you can use a large frying pan and scoop a small
      tablespoon of batter per poffertje into the pan. Serve the poffertjes warm
      with a knob of butter and powdered sugar.

      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>
        Combine flour and salt in a large bowl; gradually whisk in milk. Add
        eggs and maple syrup and mix until batter is smooth. Spoon into a piping

        Heat a poffertjes pan over high heat and lightly grease indentations.
        Fill the holes 3/4 full with batter in the piping bag and cook over high
        heat until golden brown; turn them over with a fork and cook the other
        side until golden brown.
